# odin-recipes
A project given by TOP (The Odin Project) about Eastern recipes to put my HTML, Bash, and Git knowledge to use.

The completion of this project should show that I have the basic understanding of HTML, Git, and the command line to
build the structure of a website, make repositories, commit readable messages, and use Bash to make the workflow more efficient.
