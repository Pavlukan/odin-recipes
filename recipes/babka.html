        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A babka is a sweet braided bread or cake which originated in the Jewish communities of Poland, Russia and Ukraine.
           It is prepared with a yeast-leavened dough that is rolled out and spread with a filling such as chocolate, cinnamon, fruit, or cheese, 
           then rolled up and braided before baking.</p>
        <p>It consists of either an enriched or laminated dough; 
            which are similar to those used for challah, and croissants respectively, that has been rolled out and spread with a variety of sweet fillings such as chocolate, cinnamon sugar, apples, sweet cheese, Nutella, mohn, or raisins, which is then braided either as an open or closed plait, 
            topped with a sugar syrup in order to preserve freshness and make the bread moister. 
            It is sometimes topped with a streusel topping.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All purpose flour</li>
            <li>Yeast</li>
            <li>Milk (preferably whole milk)</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Dark chocolate</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Cocoa powder</li>
            <li>Cream</li>
            <li>Powdered sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together the flour, sugar, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, milk, and salt and mix at low speed using the dough hook attachment until combined and a dough starts to form for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the butter one tablespoon at a time. Let the butter incorporate before adding more.</li>
            <li>Continue to knead for 10 more minutes; the dough is ready when it feels sticky but still very stretchy.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl, and cover. Let the dough rise for 8 hours or overnight in the fridge.</li>
            <li>When the dough is ready, divide it in half and roll them out, one at a time, on a lightly floured surface into a 12Ã—16-inch rectangle.</li>
            <li>Make the filling by combing the butter and cream in a saucepan before melting in the chocolate. Whisk in the powdered sugar and cocoa powder before letting it cool to thicken.</li>
            <li>Use an offset spatula to spread the chocolate filling over the rolled dough.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough from the short-end into a tight coil, and pinch the seam to seal. Then cut the dough in half lengthwise.</li>
            <li>Twist the halves together, keeping the cut sides facing up before transferring to a prepared loaf pan. Cover and let rise again before baking for 40 minutes or until golden brown.</li> 
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
