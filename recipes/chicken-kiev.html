            <li>1/4 teaspoon of ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of dill weed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of all-purpose flour</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place each chicken breast between a sheet of wax paper and pound, using a mallet or rolling pin, to about 3 mm.</li>
            <li>Wrap and refrigerate the chicken breasts</li>

            <li>Spread the mixture into a 5x10 cm rectangle on a piece of aluminum foil; freeze until firm.</li>
            <li>When butter is firm, cut into 8 equal size pieces and place one piece on each chicken breast. Fold in edges of chicken and roll to encase butter completely. Secure with toothpicks.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, beat eggs with water.</li>
            <li>In a shallow dish or bowl, mix together the 1/4 teaspoon pepper, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, dill weed and flour.</li>
            <li>Place bread crumbs in a separate shallow dish or bowl.</li>
            <li> Dip chicken rolls in seasoned flour, then egg mixture, then crumbs.</li>
            <li>Place coated chicken in a shallow dish, cover and refrigerate for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.</li>
            <li>When oil is hot, deep fry chicken rolls for about 5 minutes, then turn over and deep fry for another 5 minutes until golden and cooked through, with no pink showing inside.</li>
            <li>Drain on paper towels, garnish with lemon slices and parsley and serve.</li>
