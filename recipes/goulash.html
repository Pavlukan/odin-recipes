        <h1>Goulash from Eastern Europe</h1>
        <img src="../img/goulash.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Goulash is kind of in between a soup and a stew. Unlike some stews, goulash is not overly packed full of beef and vegetables, 
            it is a little more brothy. But through the cooking process, the broth becomes thicker and more like a rich sauce.</p>
        <p>And no, contrary to popular belief here in the U.S., goulash is NOT made with ground beef or (heaven forbid) macaroni noodles!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons of pork lard</li>
            <li>680 grammes of yellow onions, chopped</li>
            <li>27 grammes of quality genuine imported Hungarian sweet paprika</li>
            <li>680 grammes of stewing beef, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>5 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>2 red bell peppers, seeded, cut into 1 cm chunks</li>
            <li>1 yellow bell pepper</li>
            <li>2 tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 carrots</li>
            <li>2 medium potatoes, cut into 1 cm chunks</li>
            <li>1200 ml of beef broth (traditionally just water is used)</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of crushed caraway seeds (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the pork lard or butter/oil in a Dutch oven or other heavy soup pot over medium high heat and cook the onions until beginning to brown, about 7-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the beef and cook until the beef is just starting to brown, 7-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the bell peppers, tomatoes, and garlic and cook for another 6-8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the paprika, salt, pepper and caraway (if using) (note: paprika becomes bitter if at all scorched).</li>
            <li>Add the beef broth, bay leaf, return to the stove and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium, cover and simmer for 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the carrots and potatoes.</li>
            <li>Return to a boil, reduce the heat to medium, cover, and simmer for another 30-40 minutes or until the beef is nice and tender.</li>
            <li>Add salt to taste and remove the bay leaf.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
