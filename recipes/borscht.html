        <img src="../img/borscht.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Borscht is deep red coloured soup with cabbage, beets, potatoes, carrots, onion and garlic, and possibly beef and beans. 
               It is usually served with sour cream and dill.</p>
            <p>Borscht is a true classic soup every Ukrainian or Russian grew up eating almost weekly. 
               It can be vegan, vegetarian; with beef, pork or even chicken. It truly depends what’s in your fridge that day.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>

                <li>Pour 4 cups of the beef broth over the beef and onions in the pot. Bring to a boil and then lower the heat to a simmer.</li>
                <li>Cover and cook until the meat is falling-off-the-bone tender (about 1.5 hours)</li>

                <li>Peel and chop the beets, carrots, and potatoes into small pieces.</li>
                <li>Toss the beets and carrots with a teaspoon or two of olive oil and spread them out in a single layer on a foil lined roasting pan.</li>
                <li>Roast them in the oven for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Toss the potatoes with olive oil and make room for them in the roasting pan.</li>
                <li>Roast everything for additional 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the meat from the pot (once it's cooked).</li>
                <li>Chop the meat into bite sized pieces.</li>
                <li>Skim off any excess fat from the liquid in the pot.</li>
                <li>Return the pot to the stove and add the remaining broth, carrots, beets, and potato.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped meat to the pot, the sliced cabbage, and a half cup of the fresh dill.</li>
                <li>Bring to a simmer, and cook for another 15 minutes or so, until the cabbage is cooked through.</li>
                <li>Add the vinegar and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
                <li>Don't forget to add a dollop of sour cream when serving. Enjoy!</li>
