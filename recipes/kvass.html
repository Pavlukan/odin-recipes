        <h1>Kvass from Eastern Europe</h1>
        <img src="../img/kvass.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There are a lot of different types of kvass recipes, including beet kvass. 
            However, traditional bread kvass is a beer-like beverage made from toasted bread.</p>
        <p>It has a long history of being brewed in Eastern Europe. And simple to make at home and doesn’t require any special ingredients.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>450 grammes of bread</li>
            <li>3 litres of water</li>
            <li>2/3 cup of sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of bread yeast</li>
            <li>Flavours such as lemon peel, mint, berries, or raisins (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the bread into crouton-sized cubes. Toast them in the oven at 180 °C for 20 min.</li>
            <li>Toss halfway through to ensure even browning. The goal is to caramelize the sugars, so toast as long as necessary.</li>
            <li>Place the toasted bread cubes in a large bowl. Bring the water to a boil, and pour it over the bread.</li>
            <li>Let the bread soak for at least 4 hours (up to 24 hours). The goal is to extract the malted sugars into the boiling water.</li>
            <li>Strain liquid into a fermentation container. I recommend doing this by pouring the liquid through a cheesecloth-lined strainer, then wringing the wet bread to get all the liquid out.</li>
            <li>Stir the sugar and yeast into the liquid. Add any additional flavors at this point.</li>
            <li>Leave the kvass to ferment in a warm location to ferment for around 1 week. It will start to foam and bubble significantly after 6-12 hours.</li>
            <li>After one week, strain the kvass into swing-top beer bottles and store them in the fridge.</li>
            <li>The kvass will continue to ferment and will build up pressure, so use bottles that can handle the build-up of pressure, and pop the lid every few days.</li>
            <li>It will be ready to drink after 3 days in the fridge. However, it will continue to ferment for another 1-2 weeks until all the sugars have been consumed by the yeast.</li>
        </ol>
